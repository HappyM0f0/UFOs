<!-- When building a website. Sometimes it is helpful to create a site map that will help keep the larger picture intact. -->

<!-- # The written analysis has the following: -->

## Overview of the analysis:
<!-- * The purpose is well defined (2 pt)<br>

<br> -->

Our goal is to create an interactive webpage that allows readers to parse the data around UFO sightings.<br>

<!-- Building a page that using JavaScript that will dynamtically filter results based on user input.<br>
or<br> -->

## Results:
<!-- * There is a description of how to perform a search, with images. (4 pt)<br>

<br> -->

Using the website is simple. There are several available filters for date, city, state, country, and shape on the left-hand side.<br>

<br>

Filtering the content by typing in the desired criteria, press "Enter/Return" or deselect the input box by clicking elsewhere on the page. The example image will use "tx" for State.<br>

Afterward, the content of the table changes to the desired filter. In the image we see the results filtered to the state of "tx."<br>

## Summary:
<!-- * The summary addresses one drawback of this webpage (2 pt)<br>

<br> -->

Currently, the website data is limited and not up to date. A better user experience could be providing a drop-down for the "shape" filter as it has a limited number of options. In addition, the website also shows all of the results at once, which could be greater than 100 entries. Therefore, the table should be limited to 50-100 entries to create a better experience. 

<!-- * The summary addresses two additional recommendations for further development (4 pt)<br>

<br> -->

Two things to develop would be to limit the number of entries to 100 or fewer, could have it paged to show 100 at a time. Moreover, the website should scrap the data every week or month to keep the data set current.
